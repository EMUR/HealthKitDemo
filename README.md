# HealthKitDemo

This app uses Healthkit to obtain the user information, and then setup a customized training session by giving the user an "Egg."
That contains a unique animal. Thus the user will try to hatch the egg by working out and burn the required calories goal.
Once the goal is reached, the egg is hatched, and the user is rewarded with a unique animal. However, if the user didn't achieve
the goal by the end of the day, the egg is gone and replaced by another one the next day.
The purpose of the app is to encourage people to run/burn calories, and since the user would ideally have a curiosity of what animal
is in this egg, he/she will burn the target calories to obtain it
